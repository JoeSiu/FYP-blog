The closest game I find is a game called "Living Dark". It is also a 3D side scrolling game with a cyberpunk theme, which also focuses on graphics, world exploration as well as NPC AI interactions. Unfortunaty, the game seems to be canceled.

Another game I find is called The Last Night although its not released yet. A fans project called “Final Run” also looks visually promising and is similar to what I want to make. Both game also set place in a distant cyberpunk future.

There is also a soon be released game named "Stray" which have a similar world setting and visual style I am looking for.
